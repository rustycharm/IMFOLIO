I'll conduct a comprehensive security audit of the codebase to identify any references to Unsplash URLs that could be pulling hero banners or other images externally. Let me analyze all the relevant files systematically.

Security Audit Findings
After reviewing the entire codebase, I've identified multiple critical security vulnerabilities where Unsplash URLs are being directly referenced and fetched:

üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS:
server/unsplash-populate.ts - ACTIVE THREAT

Contains populateWithUnsplashImages() function that fetches from Unsplash API
Downloads images and stores them locally with hardcoded paths
Executes immediately on import with populateWithUnsplashImages().catch(console.error)
Uses environment variable UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY
server/unsplash-fixed.ts - ACTIVE THREAT

Contains populateWithUnsplashImagesFixed() function
Also executes immediately with populateWithUnsplashImagesFixed().catch(console.error)
Uploads fetched Unsplash images to object storage
Uses the same UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY
server/restore-missing-heroes.ts - DORMANT THREAT

Contains fetchUnsplashImage() function that calls Unsplash API
Has downloadAndStoreImage() function for external image fetching
Currently incomplete but has the infrastructure to fetch from Unsplash
üîí PROPERLY SECURED FILES:
server/hero-image-manager.ts - ‚úÖ SECURE

Comments clearly state: "External image fetching removed to prevent hero image inconsistencies"
Only uses existing object storage collection
server/populate-hero-images.ts - ‚úÖ DISABLED

Properly disabled with clear security messaging
Returns early without any external fetching
client/src/lib/backgroundImages.ts - ‚úÖ SECURE

Contains only type definitions
Comments state: "No fallbacks - only use authentic data from database"
üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE SECURITY FIXES REQUIRED
server/unsplash-populate.ts
:

server/unsplash-fixed.ts
server/restore-missing-heroes.ts
üîç ADDITIONAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
Environment Variable Cleanup: Remove or secure the UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY from your environment
Code Review: The auto-execution pattern in these files is dangerous - any import would trigger external API calls
Access Control: Ensure no other scripts can import and execute these functions
Monitoring: Check your logs for any evidence these scripts have been executed recently
üìä SECURITY IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
High Risk: Two files with immediate auto-execution of external fetching
Medium Risk: One file with dormant external fetching capabilities
Current Status: Based on console logs, the system appears to be using object storage correctly, but the vulnerable code still exists
The most critical issue is that both unsplash-populate.ts and unsplash-fixed.ts have auto-execution on import, meaning any module that imports them would immediately trigger external API calls to Unsplash.
