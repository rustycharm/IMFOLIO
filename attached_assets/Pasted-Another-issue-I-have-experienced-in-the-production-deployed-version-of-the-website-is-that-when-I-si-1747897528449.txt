Another issue I have experienced in the production deployed version of the website is that when I sign in the state of the authentication appears static - ie the user doesnt progress through to the 'signed in' state and can't access their account etc.
Can you please QA the website code and playback any findings.
Don't make any styling changes or any code changes until we've dscussed what your testing uncovers

I'll QA the website code related to authentication, specifically focusing on the issue where users don't progress to the "signed in" state after logging in. Let me analyze the relevant parts of the codebase and report my findings.

Authentication Flow Analysis
After examining the codebase, here are the key issues I've found with the authentication flow:

1. Session Management Issues
The application uses Express sessions for authentication, which are stored server-side. When a user logs in, the server sets req.session.userId, but there are potential issues with how this session is maintained when deployed:

The session might not be persisting properly in the production environment
There could be cookie handling or CORS issues
2. Authentication Status Checking
Looking at client/src/App.tsx, I notice the app doesn't have a global authentication state that's accessible throughout the application. Authentication checks happen independently in various components, which can lead to inconsistent UI states.

3. Redirect Issues After Login
In server/auth.ts, the login flow sets the session correctly, but there might be issues with how the client handles the successful login response. The client needs to properly update its state and redirect the user.

4. Apple Auth Integration Issues
The Apple Auth integration adds complexity to the authentication flow. The AppleCallback component handles authentication callbacks from Apple but there might be issues with how it communicates back to the main application.

Specific Findings
The getCurrentUser API route is called in multiple places but might fail silently when sessions expire
No centralized auth state management exists - each component checks auth independently
No explicit error handling for session timeout or invalid session scenarios
The client doesn't seem to refresh its auth state after login/logout operations
No persistent auth state in client (like localStorage backup)
No auth status loading indicator during authentication checks
Recommended Testing Steps
Before making code changes, I recommend testing the following to confirm the issues:

Check browser console for authentication-related errors
Verify if the session cookie is being set properly after login
Test the /api/auth/me endpoint directly to see if it returns the user when logged in
Check server logs for session-related errors
Test the login flow with network monitoring to see the exact request/response cycle
These findings point to an issue with authentication state management rather than the actual authentication mechanism. The application needs a more robust way to track and update the user's authentication status across the application.
